        Just below this paragraph, you'll find software engineering / web development projects from my time at DigitalCrafts. 
        Further down, you'll see my works from my years professionally running the <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> tabletop roleplaying game.  
        At the bottom of the page, you'll see a variety of ways to contact me.

                My first coding assignment, this project was written in Python and originally played in the terminal of VS Code. 
                The learning objective of this project was simple programming fundementals, object-oriented programming, and learning a new language quickly. 
                <br>
                The game itself is a text-based roleplaying game based on the tabletop roleplaying game 
                <a href="https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week/">Monster of the Week.</a>            

                It's running here using 
                <a href="https://www.brython.info/index.html">Brython,</a>
                A Python 3 implementation that makes the language compatible with HTML. 
                As a disclaimer, I of course would never use Python with the end goal of making a web application, 
                but I also don't expect anyone to download anything just to check out one of my projects. 

                <br>

                You have to start somewhere learning webpage interactivity. 
                The exact goal of this assignment and the use case of the final project (although fun) is less important than the techniques and methods I learned while working on it 
                -- mostly JavaScript and HTML fundementals and Document Object Model manipulation.
                <br> 
                In this project, you play blackjack with standard casino rules and a non-standard card deck.
                I used some assets leftover from my D&D days in this one, particularly the Tarokka deck which appears in the 
                <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/curse-strahd-revamped">Curse of Strahd adventure book</a>
                and an animated background made for play in the same adventure from

            Welcome, adventurer! By now you've likely heard that I played D&D for a living for about a year and a half. This is exceptionally unusual, so I have some explaining to do.
